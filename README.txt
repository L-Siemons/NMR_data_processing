This is a repository for NMR data processing using NMRPipe. 

In part I would like this to be an educational tool so 
it would be grand if the following rules were adhered too:

1) remove unnecessary commented lines 
2) make sure the script runs
3) please comment the sections where you do something fancy 
   like linear prediction, NUS etc... 
4) files should be named:  proc.<short_descrition>.com
5) please leave the phase correction as either 0 (when none is needed or it needs to
   be manually corrected) or 90, -90, 180 if these are the correct values. 

If you would like to contribute please feel free to email me
at Lucas.siemons@googlemail.com 

Thanks 
Lucas
