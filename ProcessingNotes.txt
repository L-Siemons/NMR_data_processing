Here are some notes regarding processing NMR spectra: 

1) Window Functions
	- Generally use the SP function but use GM if you intend to fit 
	  the spectrum with FUDA. This is because the form FUDA uses to 
	  fit functions is a mix of a Gaussian and a Lorentzian function. 

	- The -c flag should be 0.5 or 1.0. It is usually 0.5 and 1. if the 
	  phase correction is 0. or 1. 

2) Linear Prediction 

   - This shouldn't be more than 1/3 of the points in the dimension 
     you are looking at. 

   - It also depends on how many signals you wish to reconstruct along 
     a given 1D. Having to many risks introducing peaks and too few risks loosing 
     peaks.
